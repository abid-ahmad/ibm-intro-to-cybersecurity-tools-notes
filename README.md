# 🛡️ IBM – Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks

This repository contains notes from the IBM course **“Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks.”**  
It is the first course in the **IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate**. I’m documenting key lessons as part of my personal initiative to better understand **digital security within engineering systems** — a crucial skill in today’s connected ECE world.

## 🎯 Why I Took This Course

As an **Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)** student, I’m training to build embedded systems, hardware-software interfaces, and digital infrastructure.  
But **every system I help build is also a potential target for attack** — from firmware-level vulnerabilities to insecure network protocols.

This course helps me:
- Understand how real-world systems are attacked and exploited  
- Recognize risks in devices, protocols, and networks I work with  
- Think critically about integrating **security by design** into engineering workflows
