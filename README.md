# 🛡️ IBM – Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks

This repository contains my personal notes from the IBM course **“Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks”** on Coursera.  
As an **ECE student**, I’m taking this course to strengthen my understanding of how cybersecurity principles apply to engineering systems — especially as devices and infrastructure become increasingly connected and vulnerable to digital threats.

## 🎯 Why I Took This Course

As an **Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)** student, I’m training to build embedded systems, hardware-software interfaces, and digital infrastructure.  
But **every system I help build is also a potential target for attack** — from firmware-level vulnerabilities to insecure network protocols.

This course helps me:
- Understand how real-world systems are attacked and exploited  
- Recognize risks in devices, protocols, and networks I work with  
- Think critically about integrating **security by design** into engineering workflows

## 🧠 How This Supports My ECE Internships

Cybersecurity knowledge helps me:
- ✅ Design **more secure embedded systems** and IoT devices
- ✅ Identify weaknesses in **firmware, communication protocols**, and **hardware access**
- ✅ Work better with IT/Security teams during **cross-functional engineering projects**
- ✅ Apply **risk analysis** and **troubleshooting techniques** grounded in real-world scenarios
