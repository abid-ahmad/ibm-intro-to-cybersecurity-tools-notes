# 🧠 IBM – Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyberattacks (Week 1 Notes)

---

## 📌 Introduction to Cybersecurity

### 🔥 Modern Threat Landscape
- Rise in cyberattacks globally using:
  - Phishing  
  - Malware  
  - Denial-of-Service (DoS)  
  - Ransomware  
- Cybersecurity tools used to counter these include:
  - Firewalls  
  - Antivirus software  
  - Encryption  
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## 📜 History and Policy Foundations

### 🕹️ WarGames & NSDD-145
- **WarGames movie** inspired awareness of cybersecurity threats.
- Prompted President **Ronald Reagan** to implement:
  - The first national cybersecurity policy: **NSDD 145**
- NSDD-145 focused on:
  - Evaluating threats and vulnerabilities  
  - Optimizing allocation of government resources  
  - Securing all systems handling classified electronic info

## 🏛️ Government Response & Strategy

### 🛡️ Post-WarGames Cybersecurity Measures
- Creation of:
  - **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**
  - **National Cyber Security Division (NCSD)**
- Adoption of:
  - **Advanced encryption techniques** for sensitive communications  
  - "Security by design" principle  
  - Real-time surveillance + global info-sharing networks

---

### ⚠️ Cybersecurity After 9/11
- Internet exploited by terrorists for planning, communication, and radicalization
- Surge in:
  - Spamming  
  - Website defacements  
  - Denial-of-service attacks

---

## 🦠 COVID-19 & Cyber Risk Surge

### 🏠 Work-from-Home Challenges
- COVID-19 expanded virtual operations → more cyberattacks
- Key vulnerabilities:
  - **BYOD** (Bring Your Own Device) policies  
  - **Unsecured home Wi-Fi networks**

### 👥 Human Error & Awareness
- Rise in **targeted attacks** (e.g., healthcare sector)
- Emphasis on:
  - Cybersecurity awareness training  
  - Antivirus licenses for personal devices  
  - Secure handling of sensitive digital assets

## 🧠 Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity

### 🔍 Importance
- Core foundation for decision-making, innovation, and adaptation
- Enables:
  - Analyzing information objectively  
  - Anticipating threats  
  - Making informed, ethical choices

### 🧩 Skills & Models
- **Critical Thinking Model (5 elements)**:
  1. Characteristics of thought  
  2. Technical skills  
  3. Interpersonal skills  
  4. Theoretical + experimental knowledge  
  5. Intellectual abilities

- **Applications**:
  - Evaluate online info  
  - Engage in ethical & productive discussions  
  - Navigate obstacles + root cause analysis  
  - Embrace new tech + lifelong learning

### 🧠 Pivotal Critical Thinking Skills
1. **Challenge assumptions** – Go beyond surface-level info  
2. **Consider alternatives** – Break down problems: who, what, when, where, why, how  
3. **Evaluate data** – Analyze and interpret objectively  
4. **Identify key drivers** – Recognize root causes behind outcomes
