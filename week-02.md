## 🦠 Types of Malware

| Malware Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Adware** | Displays unwanted ads on a user’s device |
| **Bot** | Forms botnets to perform automated remote attacks |
| **Fileless Malware** | Operates in system memory without writing files |
| **Keylogger** | Records keystrokes to steal data |
| **Logic Bomb** | Stays dormant until triggered by an event |
| **Malvertising** | Hidden malware in online ads |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts user files, demands ransom |
| **Rootkit** | Grants unauthorized stealth access to systems |
| **Spyware** | Silently collects user data |
| **Trojan** | Pretends to be safe software while hiding malicious intent |
| **Virus** | Attaches to files and spreads via user actions |
| **Worm** | Self-replicates to spread malware without user interaction |

## 🛡️ Malware Prevention Strategies

To prevent malware attacks:
- Update OS and software
- Install a trusted antivirus
- Use strong passwords
- Be cautious with emails and downloads
- Back up important data
- Train and educate users
- Use email gateways and anti-spam filters

## 🔍 Malware Detection: Rootkit & Rkhunter

- **Rootkits** allow hackers to gain privileged (admin) access and stay hidden
- **Rkhunter** (Rootkit Hunter) scans systems for:
  - Unauthorized remote access tools
  - Misconfigurations
  - Known malware signatures

### 📋 Rkhunter Works By:
- Scanning file systems  
- Comparing command outputs to known threats  
- Auditing configs  
- Reporting suspicious behavior

## 🧠 Social Engineering Techniques

| Attack Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Phishing** | Fake login/email to steal credentials |
| **Spear Phishing** | Personalized, targeted phishing |
| **Whaling** | Spear phishing targeting executives |
| **Vishing** | Voice/phishing via phone calls |
| **Tailgating** | Physical breach when someone slips in behind authorized person |
| **Impersonation** | Pretending to be someone trusted to gain access |
| **Dumpster Diving** | Searching trash for valuable info |
| **Shoulder Surfing** | Peeking at someone’s screen or password |
| **Hoax** | Spreading false alarms to manipulate actions |
| **Watering Hole Attack** | Infecting websites that the target frequently visits
